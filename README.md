# ThisWholeThingIsSoSinisterThatJasonMooreMustBeVisitingSinisterWebsites-NormalPeopleDontDoThisStuff

dont EVER make your IG public as I have kept mine private as well for years now

this is a seriously lonely person who spends a lot of time on the internet who has serious personal and career failings

its as debashish said to me in undergrad: "dont give someone with too much free time on their hands SOMETHING TO DO"

dont be surprised if this is actually true, it happens more often than u think, i was not born yesterday, i know something is really off here
