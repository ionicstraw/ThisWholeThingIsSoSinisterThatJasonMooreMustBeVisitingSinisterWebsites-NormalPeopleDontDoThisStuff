# ThisWholeThingIsSoSinisterThatJasonMooreMustBeVisitingSinisterWebsites-NormalPeopleDontDoThisStuff

dont EVER make your IG public as I have kept mine private as well for years now

this is a seriously lonely person who spends a lot of time on the internet who has serious personal and career failings

its as debashish said to me in undergrad: "dont give someone with too much free time on their hands SOMETHING TO DO"

dont be surprised if this is actually true, it happens more often than u think, i was not born yesterday, i know something is really off here

hes actually been enjoying how sinister and sadistic he is, that's not normal, that's not normal behavior at all --- well too bad, it'll blow up in penn's face

sucks bc i would really like to put my art on IG and ppl are nice they give good feedback and make nice comments, but no, my younger cousins and my family are all there >:(
